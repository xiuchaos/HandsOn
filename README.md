## Part I The fundamentals of machine learning

### 1. the machine learning landscape
> hyper-parameter decides the amount of regularization to apply during learning, it must be set prior to training and remains constant during training.
   * Testing and validating

### 2. End-to-End machine learning project
   * Looking the big picture
      * frame the problem
      * select a performance measure
      * check the assumptions
   
   * Dicover and visulize the data to gain insights
     * visualizing geographical data
     * looking for correlations
     * experimenting with attribute combinations
     
   * Preparing the data for machine learning algrothims
     * data cleaning
     * custom transformers
     * feature scaling
     * transformation pipelines
   
  * Select and train a model
   
  * Fine-Tune your model
      * grid search
      * randomized search
      * ensemble methods
      * analyze the best models and their errors
 
 * Launch, monitor and maintain your system
     

### 3. Classification
   * performance measures
      ** accuracy using cross validation
      ** confusion matrix
     precision and recall
     precison/recall tradeoff
     the roc curve
     
### 4. Training Models 
   * Linear regression
   * Gradient descent
   * Polynomial regression
   * Regularized linear models
   * Logistic regression
 
### 5. Support vector machine
   * Linear SVM classification
   * Nonlinear SVM classification
   * SVM regression
   * Under the hood
   
### 6. Decision Tree
   
### 7. Ensemble learning and random forests

### 8. Dimensionality Reduction
